# Sprints at Packback

Engineering teams at Packback divide their work into sprints. To manage this work across multiple teams, we use the [Large Scale Scrum Framework](https://less.works/less/framework) (or LeSS).

## Sprint meetings and checklists

Sprints are two weeks long (from Tuesday to Tuesday) and follow a regular cadence of meetings:

- Team sprint planning
- Sync-up (daily)
- Division sprint planning
- Team pre-planning
- Team retrospective
- Sprint retrospective and demo

### Team sprint planning

This meeting marks the start of a new sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to:

- align on team-level goals for the new sprint
- resolve any outstanding questions about planned work
- create a plan to meet the sprint goals

**Who participates?** The members of an individual team.

**When does this meeting happen?** At the start of each sprint, Tuesday afternoon, right the sprint retrospective and demo.

### Daily sync-up

This meeting (elsewhere referred to as stand up or scrum) should last no more than 15 minutes. The purpose of sync-up is to coordinate within the team (and accross teams if needed) to ensure they meet their sprint goals.

Each team member should answer:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are you running into any blockers or problems?

At the end of sync up, we also ask if anyone has noticed any problems or opportunities for improvement. Sharing an opportunity doesn't mean you will be responsible for implementing it.

**Who participates?** The members of an individual team. Additionally, members of other teams may join and observe to facilitate communication and cross-team collaboration.

**When does this meeting happen?** Daily, usually around midday.

### Division sprint planning

The goal of division sprint planning is to:

- identify which tickets should be estimated next sprint
- surface questions, problems, and blockers for the selected tickets
- determine which teams will be responsible for the selected tickets

**Who participates?** TPMs, team leads, and certain backlog owners. Teams may decide who to send to this meeting, such as a DRI (project lead).

**When does this meeting happen?** Towards the end of the sprint before individual team pre-plannings.

### Team pre-planning

The goal of team pre-planning is to:

- estimate tickets selected for next sprint
- surface questions, problems, and blockers for the selected tickets
- determine sprint goals for the upcoming sprint

**Who participates?** The members of an individual team.

**When does this meeting happen?** The day before the end of the sprint.

### Team retrospective

The goal of team retrospective is to:

- discuss any opportunities for improvement mentioned during the sprint
- discuss any other problems or opportunities for improvement
- make a plan to implement opportunities that the team decides are worthwhile
- record any tickets that took longer than expected and the reason did (this data will be aggregated for later use)

**Who participates?** The members of an individual team.

**When does this meeting happen?** At the end of the sprint, just before the sprint retrospective and demo.

### Sprint retrospective and demo

This meeting marks the end of a sprint. The goal of sprint retrospective is to:

- discuss any opportunities from team retrospectives that would be helpful to discuss at an organizational level
- give shout outs to teammates for exemplary performance

The goal of sprint demo is for each team to share with the rest of the organization:

- what they accomplished last sprint
- their sprint goals for next sprint

**Who participates?** All members of the Engineering org.

**When does this meeting happen?** At the very end of the sprint on Tuesday afternoon.
