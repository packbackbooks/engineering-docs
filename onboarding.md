# Onboarding at Packback

Welcome to Packback! Weâ€™re excited to have you as part of the team. The goal of our onboarding process is to equip you with everything you need to be a fully contributing member of the team as quickly as possible.

## Your First Day

On your first day, you will meet with your manager and go over the following items:

- Onboarding Checklist
- 30/60/90 Day Goals
- Paired Team Mentor

### Onboarding Checklist

On your first day, you should create a copy of the Onboarding Checklist Template and begin working through the items on the checklist. The expectation is that your checklist should be complete by your 30-day review. Your manager will review it with you as part of that review.

### 30/60/90 Day Goals

On your first day, you and your manager will review a set of goals with you. These goals are in place to set expectations and provide a framework to ensure that you are successfully performing the duties of your role. Upon successfully fulfilling your 30/60/90 Day Goals, you will be a full contributing member of the Packback Engineering team.

Your manager will schedule a meeting with you at the 30-, 60-, and 90-day marks of your employment at Packback. At each interval, you and your manager will evaluate your performance as measured against the goals for the completed interval and make plans to ensure that you succeed at the goals for the next interval. Failure to meet these goals may result in disciplinary action or termination.

### Paired Team Mentor

Each new hire is assigned a team mentor from the team that they are on. You and your mentor will meet regularly during your onboarding process. In addition to your manager, they are there to be a resource to you. Your mentor should be your first line of defense for any questions you have, including about: team processes, our code base, the company, the product, etc.
