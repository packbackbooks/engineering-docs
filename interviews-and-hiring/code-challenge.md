# The Code Challenge

The first stage of our application is an automated code challenge on remoteinterview.io. The purpose of this step of the interview process is to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your fluency in the coding language of your choice.

This challenge is performed entirely in your web browser, should take approximately one hour to complete, and consists of 3 questions that test your ability to use code to solve simple problems.

## Instructions

* The code challenge invite arrives in a separate email from `remoteinterview.io`. Check your spam folder if you can't see it. If you cannot find the email, contact us and let us know.
* Once you have started the challenge you cannot pause it, so please be somewhere you can focus for an hour.
* Please complete the challenge within 7 days of receiving the invitation.
* You may run your code as many times as you want. Testing and debugging are part of the job. We care more about the final product than getting it right the first time. Use whichever language you prefer. Packback uses Typescript/JavaScript, PHP, and Python, but we are mainly interested in seeing how you write code.
* We are primarily interested in the correctness of your answers. If you have time left over after you finished, feel free to spend it adding documentation, testing, and optimizations. However, focus first on getting the correct answer.
* *Please* do all of your work in the web browser, don't work elsewhere and then copy and paste complete answers into the window. Doing this prevents us from seeing how you did your work.
* The instructions of the code challenge on Remote Interview include a sample test. The code question on the sample test is similar to the questions on the code challenge; we recommend that you complete that question before starting the actual challenge.

## What Can I Expect After the Screen?

Within a few days of you completing the screen, a member of our hiring team will contact you via email with the next steps.

## Why Begin With This Automated Screen?

Packback takes its commitment to diversity and inclusion very seriously. After our initial resume screen, the use of an automated challenge lets us allow the widest variety of candidates, including those with non-typical backgrounds, to demonstrate their coding abilities before moving forward to meet with members of our team.
