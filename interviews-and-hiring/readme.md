## The Interview Process

Our interview process consists of 4 steps:

* Application received
* [Code challenge](code-challenge.md)
* Phone interview
* Team interview

Once we receive your application, the first step is an automated code challenge. This step of the interview process gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your fluency in the coding language of your choice. You will have a week to complete the challenge, which takes 60 minutes.

We will also schedule a phone interview with a manager from our engineering team. During this interview, we will discuss your background and experience, and give you the opportunity to ask any questions you have about the role, team, and company. The conversation will take about 30 minutes.

Once you have completed the code challenge and the phone interview, the final step is the team interview.

### The Team Interview

This interview consists of several sessions including technical conversations with members of our engineering team and behavioral conversations with management. The team interview lasts up to 3 and a half hours, so expect to spend a full morning or afternoon in the process.

* The interview will be conducted over Google Hangouts and Google Drive.
* We ask all participants in the interview to have webcams turned on for the duration of the session. If this is not possible (e.g. you don't have a webcam), please let us know ahead of time.
* You will be asked to share your screen during the session.
* You will need a computer set up to code on. Have a web framework of your choice installed on which you can build a ReST API and serve a hello world page. (If this is not possible, please let us know if as soon as possible so that we can find an alternative.)
