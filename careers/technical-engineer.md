# Technical Engineer Path

The technical engineer focuses on individual contributorship and technical leadership. Their contributions level up the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of the entire organization. Whereas the [software engineer path](software-engineer.md) focused on mastering the fundamentals of software development using a defined set of criteria, the senior technical path focuses more on projects/efforts that have strategic value for the company while driving technical design and up-leveling their team. As engineers progress down this path, examples of success will be less pre-defined and more dependent on the contextual needs of the business.

## Senior Engineer

**Technical Knowledge:** They have deep understanding of their technical specialty, and a working of knowledge of other domains. They take responsibility for the overall health and quality of their domain. They have responsibilities beyond writing code (managing audits, running on-call rotations, owning a backlog, etc.) to help them manage their domain within the organization. Feedback on their code usually revolves around subjective decisions, rather than objective issues.

**Productivity:** A senior engineer regularly delivers a high volume of complex, critical work while also balancing other responsibilities or initiatives. ### MORE ###

**Impact:** Beyond just delivering work on our roadmap, a senior engineer helps implement innovations across our codebase and department. They recognize and act upon opportunities that others miss.

**Communication:** They are comfortable pushing back against or advocating for initiatives to safeguard the best interests of the organization. When pairing with more junior team members, they guide the conversation by asking questions instead of just providing answers.

**Collaboration:** They ensure that they do not become a single point of failure for their domain by mentoring and training others. When relevant, they work effectively with others outside the organization (whether in other departments or with vendors).

## Staff Engineer

**Technical Direction:** Technology cannot speak for itself and requires effective advocates on its behalf. Staff engineers successfully advance technology by being pragmatic, deliberate, and focused more on the long-term trend of progress than viewing each individual decision as a make-or-break crisis. Staff engineers essentially act like part-time product manager for technology.

Concrete examples could include:

- Lead or delegate extra-large projects across teams
- Oversee cross-team initiatives (a11y, code quality, testing, reliability, etc.)
- Solve problems that span multiple groups

**Engineering Perspective:** Staff-plus engineers are the folks who will often get unexpectedly pulled into the room where this sort of decision is happening. This gives them the opportunity to inject the engineering context and perspective into a decision while it's still possible to change the outcome. These brief moments of input on critical decisions are unduly impactful and will allow you to inject an engineering perspective where it would otherwise be missed.

Concrete examples could include:

- Your perspective is sought out in critical decisions
- Actively inserting yourself into these critical moments
- Advocate for effective solutions and strategies
- Bringing perspective from other teams or departments

**Mentorship:**

A Staff Engineer is far more likely to change your company's long-term trajectory by growing other engineers than through personal heroics. Their work leads to a well-trained team with multiple experts in each domain.

Effective mentorship is not a checkbox on the career ladder that can be satisfied by simply sharing advice an experience. Staff engineers build an ongoing relationship, understands the context of their mentee, and [sponsors](https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/) them.

Concrete examples could include:

- Owning onboarding and continuing education initiatives
- No bus-factor-one concerns / build redundancy in systems and knowledge
- Providing critical feedback on architectural design documents
- Sponsorship

**Exploration:**

Our teams are already optimized to incrementally improve. The role of the staff engineer is to be transformative.

We donâ€™t care if you walk to the top of a small hill, we want you to jump to a new, bigger hill.

Any ambiguous, important problem that the company's systems are ill-shaped to address. It might be reducing your infrastructure costs by an order of magnitude. It might be identifying a multi-region strategy that takes six months instead of three years. It might be addressing the sudden realization that your primary database only has three months of remaining disk space, and you can't upgrade to a larger size

This is also related to breadth of what you impact... Should be more than just "I make my part of the codebase better".

Concrete examples could include:

- Tackle impossible technical problems (high ambiguity, no in-house expertise, poorly defined problems)
- Reduce existential risk
- Consider org-level problems (2-3 year growth, org health), beyond just team/project problems
- Set the technical direction for a department

**Be Glue:**

Perhaps most difficult to define, Staff Engineers do [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue). They see the important things that need done and make sure they happen (whether doing it themselves or finding the right person or process for the job).

Concrete examples could include:

- decreased onboarding time
- got the team to agree on coding standards
- reviewed designs and architecture decisions
- made us build the right thing
- made our customers happier
- public speaking/writing that raised the organization's profile
- simplified security and compliance concerns

The Staff Engineer has strategic impact over some combination of a large team, a very deep technical problem, and/or a long time horizon. The problems that the staff engineer is solving are open-ended.

**Technical Knowledge:** A staff engineer is capable of taking untangling and solving complex problems with high uncertainty outside their own domain. They can gain context and become effective in a new domain quickly.

**Productivity:**

**Impact:** The impact of their solutions go beyond the scope of the project or team that they are working on; they set examples for other engineers to follow.

**Communication:**

**Collaboration:**

## Principal Engineer

This person acts as the "chief architect" for our business. They have significant strategic vision and can take a high-level 3-5 year plan for growth at a business level and translate that into a strategic technology roadmap. They are deeply technically savvy, and their primary job is focusing on the architectural and technological needs to grow the business over the longer-term horizon. The principal engineer is able to plan and execute on tasks across all of Packback's engineering domains (including but not limited to: frontend dev, backend dev, site-reliability-engineering, QA and data analysis)

This level signifies strategic impact over the team. The Principal Engineer deals with very deep technical problems and a long time horizon. The problems that the Principal Engineer is solving are very open-ended even to the leadership who presented the problem.
