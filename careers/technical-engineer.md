# Technical Engineer Path

The technical engineer focuses on individual contributorship and technical leadership

## Senior Engineer

Success as a Senior Engineer is based on their ability to make the team and individuals on the team more effective. A Senior Engineer's technical impact should be focused on using technology to increase the likelihood that Packback succeeds as a business. A Senior Engineer at Packback should be focused on making a 10x impact on the team; which can only be done by empowering others, optimizing processes, and identifying the highest impact projects. They are proficient at project management.

**Technical Ability:** The Senior Engineer should be seen as a solid engineer who is a go-to expert in at least one domain (e.g. frontend, backend, data, databases, site-reliability-engineering). The Senior Engineer is capable of owning technical design for projects of moderate complexity (measured in multiple sprints), and understands the trade-offs in creating good software in their area. They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without issues. In addition to writing consistently high-quality (i.e. largely bug free, idiomatic, performant, secure, architecturally sound, appropriately abstracted) code they are aware of industry best practices and trends, and have acquired at least one major skill outside of core coding such as monitoring, documentation, integration testing, visual design, performance optimization.

**Technical Scope:** The Senior Engineer gets a lot done. They are responsible for complex tasks and complete them despite roadblocks, grabbing others for help or insight as necessary. The Senior Engineer requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex product problem with no defined solution and implement a plan to solve it. The Senior Engineer shows initiative beyond knocking tasks off a list; they are able to identify and suggest areas of future work for themselves or their teams. They seek to build objective and well-defended cases for decisions, and develop a reputation among the leadership team that their requests are objective, self-critical and have due-diligence put in place to understand all viable alternatives. They deliver products with confidence.

The Senior Engineer has end-to-end responsibility for projects of increasing complexity that encompass more than their own development. They contribute to the common code bases and standards for the team. They understand the business that their code supports and use this knowledge to influence their task prioritization. They assist in identifying and validating test cases and can identify regression risks in their features. They develop contingency plans around minimizing risks to delivery. They maintain a laser focus on the customer's needs as they relate to business goals, as they realize that every project comes at the opportunity cost of another project, and therefore think about their time and the team's time as an investment, and seek opportunities that will bring the biggest return for the customer and the business.

**Communication:** The Senior Engineer is known outside their core team as a technology leader. They participate extensively in code reviews, and mentor others via code reviews and pairing, as well as frequently presenting at team meetings. They work effectively with non-tech members of the Packback community. They are able to identify problems with requirements and help their team course-correct around these issues.

**Responsibilities:**

* Backlog or code quality ownership for one or more domains
* Recognize impediments to our efficiency as a team ("technical debt"); propose and implement solutions
* Plan and manage projects (DRI) on the scale of a trimester
* Identify risks in code, features, and design, and communicate these to the appropriate parties early in the design process
* Anticipate problems across our codebase and proactively address
* Provide mentorship to Software Engineers to help them grow in their technical responsibilities

## Staff Engineer

The Staff Engineer has strategic impact over some combination of a large team, a very deep technical problem, and/or a long time horizon. The problems that the staff engineer is solving are open-ended.

**Technical Ability:** The Staff Engineer provides considerable high-level technical guidance across the team. They can usually anticipate and plan for technical problems. They are highly knowledgeable in major parts of our technology stack and are the technical owner of significant components of our code base. They have a sustained track record of creating improvements in business-critical systems around stability, performance, and scalability.

**Technical Scope:** A Staff Engineer is still acting in a very hands-on role, and as such, they are a prolific contributor to both core projects at Packback and to side and experimental work. When presented with a complex problem, process or existing system they are able to reduce the complexity in order to get more done with less work. They provide guidance, direction and help colleagues build and produce better outcomes.

**Communication:** The Staff Engineer has strong abilities to influence without requiring reporting authority. They facilitate cross-team work and are influential beyond their individual group. They are capable of driving groups of disparate interests to decisions, and clearly communicating and seeing those decisions through to impact. The staff engineer is a very strong communicator and can simplify technical concepts in a way to explain them to non-technical partners. The staff engineer is capable of setting short to medium term strategic direction for part of the technology stack, identifying areas of critical need based on future growth and developing roadmaps to attack those problems. The Staff Engineer may act as the leader of a technical team but is probably not acting as the people manager of fellow engineers.

**Responsibilities:**

* Track metrics to ensure code quality standards
* Advocate for improvements to product quality, security, and performance
* Maintains a comprehensive technical knowledge of our entire software system
* Assume responsibility for fixing problems / "Always Responsible Individual"
* Participate in Tier 2 on-call rotations
* Managing projects across multiple trimesters

Principal Engineer
This person acts as the "chief architect" for our business. They have significant strategic vision and can take a high-level 3-5 year plan for growth at a business level and translate that into a strategic technology roadmap. They are deeply technically savvy, and their primary job is focusing on the architectural and technology needs to grow the business over the longer-term horizon. The principal engineer is able to plan and execute for tasks across all of Packback's engineering domains (including but not limited to: frontend dev, backend dev, site-reliability-engineering, QA and data analysis)

This level signifies strategic impact over the team. The Principal Engineer deals with very deep technical problems and a long time horizon. The problems that the Principal Engineer is solving are very open-ended even to the leadership who presented the problem.

**Technical Ability:** The Principal Engineer is sought-after for technical guidance across the team. They have a track record of anticipating technical problems that will fall out of major products and designing solutions to overcome those problems. They are deeply knowledgeable in major parts of our technology stack and are the technical owner of large parts of our code base. They have a sustained track record of creating major improvements in large business-critical systems around stability, security, performance, and scalability.

A Principal Engineer is still acting in a very hands-on role, and as such, they are a prolific contributor to both core projects at Packback and to side and experimental work. When presented with a complex problem, process or existing system they are consistently able to reduce the complexity in order to get more done with less work. This ability to manage and simplify complexity is the hallmark of the Principal Engineer; working with this person should leave team members feeling like they are going to leave with something significantly better than they came into.

**Technical Scope:** The Principal Engineer has broad impact across Packback tech. They create architecture that shapes large parts of our business, and ship complex projects including many systems or major pieces of infrastructure. The impact of their work is felt across the team in the quality of the engineering that we produce, the ways we write code, the core libraries that we use, and the underlying design of systems. There are multiple obvious large technical contributions that can be pointed to as originating from this team member.

**Communication:** The Principal Engineer has excellent abilities to influence without requiring reporting authority to do so. They effectively facilitate cross-team work and are influential far beyond their individual group. They are capable of driving groups of disparate interests to decisions, and clearly communicating and seeing those decisions through to impact. The Principal Engineer is capable of setting short, medium and long term strategic direction for part of the technology stack, identifying areas of critical need based on future growth and developing roadmaps to attack those problems.

**Responsibilities:**

* Define strategic technical initiatives
* Solve technical problems of the highest scope and complexity for the entire organization
* Actively seek out and prioritize our toughest technical challenges with a goal of creating significant improvement
* Define code quality standards and metrics
* Provide mentorship to Senior and Staff Engineers to help them grow in their technical responsibilities
* Ensure the safety and reliability of Packback's technology
* Manage projects across multiple years
