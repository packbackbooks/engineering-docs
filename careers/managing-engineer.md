# Managing Engineer Path

The managing engineer path focuses on team and organizational leadership.

Regardless of the level, all managers are fundamentally measured by whether their team(s):

* build the right thing the right way
* foster growth, productivity, and excellence
* operate as a black box while offering full observability

## Team Lead (Senior Engineer)

A Team Lead manages a team according to agile principles. They are learning the ropes of people management and are proficient project managers. As a leader they track the team's efficiency and quality of work and work alongside their teammates to ensure timely delivery of high quality work. They should be focused on making a 10x impact on the team; which can only be done by empowering others, optimizing processes, and identifying the highest impact projects.

**Technical Ability:** Still primarily focused on writing code, they should start identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team and clearing these roadblocks. They are capable of owning technical design for projects of moderate complexity. They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without issues. In addition to writing consistently high-quality (i.e. largely bug free, idiomatic, performant, secure, architecturally sound, appropriately abstracted) code they are aware of industry best practices and trends, and have acquired at least one major skill outside of their core area expertise such as monitoring, documentation, integration testing, visual design, performance optimization.

**Technical Scope:** They are responsible for complex tasks and complete them despite roadblocks, grabbing others for help or insight as necessary. The Team Lead requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex user story, break it down into the necessary tasks, and complete it with relative ease.

In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the Team Lead will partner closely with the product team to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing on the performance of their current team, they assist with any hiring and recruitment efforts for their team.

**Communication:** The Team Lead gets support from their manager. They focus on developing skills to manage team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and they solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently. Additionally, they identify areas of technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the Product and Engineering teams.

**Responsibilities:**

* Run a productive, agile team
* Run [sprint-cadence team meetings](../the-sprint.md#what-goes-into-a-sprint)
* Track team and individual performance metrics
* Offer professional development (1:1s and performance reviews) for individual contributors
* Assist with hiring / people management
* Implement minor process improvements
* Project planning and management
* ~80% direct contributorship

## Engineering Manager

The Engineering Manager is a senior manager responsible for running several teams. They are comfortable with management practices and are strong project managers. As a leader they track the team's efficiency and quality of work, and they assist in regularly adjusting processes and timelines to ensure high-quality work is delivered.

**Technical Ability:** The Engineering Manager will spend less time writing code, but there is an expectation that they still engage in some technical deliverables such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team. More than writing code, they hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team. They work actively to clear these roadblocks.

**Technical Scope:** This role is expected to have a large impact on the success of their team as a whole. In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the Engineering Manager will partner closely with the product team to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing the team, they are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs.

**Communication:** The Engineering Manager is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently. Additionally, they identify areas of technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the Product and Engineering teams.

**Responsibilities:**

* Everything a team lead does plus...
* Run periodic meetings (Team OKRs, Term/Year retros)
* Build tools to enable tracking of performance metrics
* Manage individual contributors
* Implement major process improvements
* 20-80% direct contributorship
