# Managing Engineer Path

The managing engineer path focuses on team and organizational leadership.

## Team Lead (Senior Engineer)

A Team Lead is the manager of a small to mid-sized team according to agile principles. They are learning the ropes of people management and are proficient project managers. As a leader they track the team's efficiency and quality of work and work alongside their teammates to ensure timely delivery of high quality work. They should be focused on making a 10x impact on the team; which can only be done by empowering others, optimizing processes, and identifying the highest impact projects.

**Technical Ability:** Still primarily focused on writing code, they should start identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team and clearing these roadblocks. They are capable of owning technical design for projects of moderate complexity (measured in multiple sprints). They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without issues. In addition to writing consistently high-quality (i.e. largely bug free, idiomatic, performant, secure, architecturally sound, appropriately abstracted) code they are aware of industry best practices and trends, and have acquired at least one major skill outside of core coding such as monitoring, documentation, integration testing, visual design, performance optimization.

**Technical Scope:** They are responsible for complex tasks and complete them despite roadblocks, grabbing others for help or insight as necessary. The Team Lead requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex user story, break it down into sub-tasks, and complete their sub-tasks with relative ease.

In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the Team Lead will partner closely with the product team to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing on the performance of their current team, they assist with any hiring and recruitment efforts for their team.

**Communication:** The Team Lead gets support from their manager. They focus on developing skills to manage team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and they solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently. Additionally, they identify areas of technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the Product and Engineering teams.

**Responsibilities:**

* Run a productive, agile team
* Run [sprint-cadence team meetings](../the-sprint.md#what-goes-into-a-sprint)
* Track team and individual performance metrics
* Offer professional development (1:1s and performance reviews) for individual contributors
* Assist with hiring / people management
* Implement minor process improvements
* Project planning and management
* ~80% direct contributorship

## Engineering Manager

The Engineering Manager is the manager of a small to mid-sized team. They are comfortable with management practice and are strong project managers. As a leader they ensure that they are tracking the team's efficiency and quality of work, they assist in regularly adjusting processes and timelines to ensure high quality work is delivered.

**Technical Ability:** The Engineering Manager will spend less time writing code, but there is an expectation that they still engage in some technical deliverables such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team. More than writing code, they hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for their team. They work actively to clear these roadblocks.

**Technical Scope:** This role is expected to have a large impact on the success of their team as a whole. In particular, leaders in this role are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping their team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused, the Engineering Manager will partner closely with the product team to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing the team, they are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs.

**Communication:** The Engineering Manager is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently. Additionally, they identify areas of technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the Product and Engineering teams.

**Responsibilities:**

* Everything a team lead does plus...
* Run periodic meetings (Team OKRs, Term/Year retros)
* Build tools to enable tracking of performance metrics
* Manage individual contributors
* Implement major process improvements
* 20-80% direct contributorship

## Director of Engineering

The Engineering Director is responsible for functional slices of the Engineering organization. The Engineering Director will typically lead engineering managers across multiple teams.

**Technical Ability:** The Engineering Director is not generally expected to write code on a daily basis, although part of every sprint should be spent in technical work. The Engineering Director should have a strong technical background and spend some of their time researching new technologies and staying abreast of trends in the tech industry. They will be expected to help debug and triage critical systems, and should understand the systems they oversee well enough to perform code reviews and help research problems as needed. They should contribute to the architecture and design efforts primarily by serving as the technically-savvy voice that asks business and product questions of the engineers on their teams, ensuring that the code we are writing matches the product and business needs and can scale appropriately as those needs grow.

**Technical Scope:** The Engineering Director is primarily concerned with ensuring smooth execution of complex deliverables. To that end, they focus on ensuring that we continually evaluate and refine our development/infrastructure standards and processes to create technology that will deliver sustained value to the business. They are responsible for creating high performance, high velocity organizations, measuring and iterating on processes as we grow and evolve as a business. They are the leaders for recruiting, headcount management and planning, career growth and training for the organization. As necessary, directors will manage vendor relationships and participate in the budgeting process.

The impact of an Engineering Director should reach across multiple areas of the technology organization. They are responsible for creating and growing the next generation of leadership and management talent in the organization, helping that talent learn how to balance technical and people management. They are obsessed with creating high-functioning, engaged and motivated organizations, and they are expected to own retention goals in their organization. Additionally, Engineering Directors are responsible for strategically balancing immediate and long-term product/business focused work with technical debt and strategic technical development.

**Communication:** Directors are strong leaders, and set the example for cross-functional collaboration both between Engineering and other areas of the company, and across Engineering teams. The goal of this collaboration is to create both a strategic and tactical roadmap that tackles both business needs, efficiencies and revenue as well as fundamental technology innovation. 

The engineering director is able to take business direction and explain it to the technology team in a way that inspires and guides them. Directors of Engineering help to create a positive public presence for Packback Engineering and are capable of selling the company to potential candidates.

**Responsibilities:**

* Run of a group of teams focused on a sector of the business
* Define relevant performance metrics, agile project management skills
* Manage team leads and engineering managers
* Manage hiring efforts and provide input on staffing plans
* Set department mission, vision and OKRs
* Manage vendor and external relationships
* Less than 20% direct contributorship with a focus on strategic, high-impact contributions

## VP of Engineering

The VP of Engineering is responsible for nurturing the team's culture and recognizing when to let the team evolve and when to guide its growth. They oversee the team's capacity and availability and are an advocate for steady progress on the product, the infrastructure, and the total system health.

The VP represents Engineering and Data on the senior team to articulate the capabilities and needs of the department. They are responsible for understanding the system's construction and having a sense of opportunity and cost. They communicate technical impact in simple, clear terms.
