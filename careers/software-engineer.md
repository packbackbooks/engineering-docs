# Software Engineer Path

The goal of the Software Engineer path is to train engineers to master the fundamentals of software engineering and prepare them to succeed in one of the senior pathways.

## Apprentice

An apprentice engineer is focused on learning the basic skills of software engineering.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have a theoretical understanding of core concepts and best practices, but have limited practical experience with them. Certain key concepts may be unfamiliar to them. They know how to write basic code and can identify when their code has broken an existing test, but may be unfamiliar with many of the tools and techniques needed to make code well-abstracted and performant.

**Productivity:** They are capable of completing small, well-defined tasks with help from other engineers. Consulting with teammates before each ticket, they develop a plan to complete it on time. They can develop an initial plan to test their code but may need help completing it.

**Impact:** They take on work that helps the team meet its sprint goals. They focus on learning and participating in the team's process, and consistently make their best attempt to follow the styles within each project.

**Communication:** They ask questions to understand how their work fits into the larger context. They proactively communicate whether their work is ahead, on track, or behind. They welcome feedback and apply the feedback they received in other contexts.

**Collaboration:** They pair frequently. When starting a new task, they develop a plan for how to accomplish it and validate that plan with a teammate. When stuck for more than 30 minutes on a problem, they get help.

## Engineer I

An engineer II is capable of taking on well-defined technical problems and managing their own work each sprint.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have a theoretical understanding of the core concepts and best practices of software engineering and have some practical experience implementing them. They understand the basics of writing performant, well-abstracted code, but need help with complex tasks and tasks outside their specialization.

**Productivity:** They are capable of completing small, well-defined tasks on time with minimal help from other engineers. They are mindful of their technical limitations and take them into account when planning their work. They focus on reliably delivering quality work on time.

**Impact:** They take on work that helps the team meet its sprint goals. They actively participate in team norms, processes, and expectations. They focus on the work assigned to them in a sprint.

**Communication:** They ask questions to understand how their work fits into the larger context. They proactively communicate whether their work is ahead, on track, or behind and are especially mindful about communicating when work is taking longer than expected. They welcome feedback and apply the feedback they received in other contexts.

**Collaboration:** They pair frequently. They are able to quickly recognize when they are stuck and ask for help. For more complicated tasks, they leverage the knowledge of their peers to plan and execute their work on time. They actively participate in code review and offer feedback to others.

## Engineer II

An engineer II is capable of taking on most technical problems and coordinating work spanning several sprints.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have practical experience implementing the core concepts and best practices of software engineering. They are able to write performant, well-abstracted code with minimal help from other engineers. They are able to solve most problems in their domain, but may need help with complex tasks and tasks outside their domain.

**Productivity:** They reliably deliver the work assigned to them in a sprint. When they encounter a complex problem, they leverage the knowledge of their peers to find a suitable solution, even if it means changing the scope of the work.

**Impact:** They can take the lead on delivering sprint goals and are capable of planning work that multiple engineers can complete in a single sprint.

**Communication:** They are able to effectively review code in their area of expertise and regularly point out opportunities for improvement in the code that they review.

**Collaboration:** They are mindful of the work that others are doing and can critique or suggest improvements to the proposed plans of others. They get help from others when stuck, but are also capable of helping unstick their peers.

## Engineer III

An engineer III is capable of taking on complex technical problems and coordinating work spanning several months.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have robust understanding of their technical specialty, and a working of knowledge of other domains. They can solve most problems in their domain. Their code is well-abstracted and performant as a rule and rarely needs a significant refactor at the PR stage.

**Productivity:** They are capable of delivering a large volume of work regardless of the complexity/uncertainty of the work.

**Impact:** They are able to plan work for multiple engineers that will take several sprints to complete. They can identify strategic opportunities and risks with a proposed plan and affect the direction of the team.

**Communication:** They point out novel opportunities for refactoring during code review.

**Collaboration:** Others on the team reach out for help in their area of expertise, and they make themselves available.
