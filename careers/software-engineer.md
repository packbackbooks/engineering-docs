# Software Engineer Path

The goal of the Software Engineer path is to train engineers to master the fundamentals of software engineering and prepare them to succeed in one of the senior pathways.

## Apprentice (IC 1)

An apprentice engineer focuses on learning the basic skills of software engineering.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have a theoretical understanding of core concepts and best practices but have limited practical experience with them. Certain key concepts may be unfamiliar to them. They know how to write basic code and can identify when their code has broken an existing test, but may be unfamiliar with many of the tools and techniques needed to make code well-abstracted and performant.

**Productivity:** They are capable of completing small, well-defined tasks with limited uncertainty with help from other engineers. Consulting with teammates before each ticket, they develop a plan to complete it on time. They can develop an initial plan to test their code but may need help completing it.

**Impact:** They take on work that helps the team meet its sprint goals. They focus on learning and participating in the team's process, and demonstrate consistent improvement in adhering to the styles within each project.

**Communication:** They ask questions to understand how their work fits into the larger context. They proactively communicate whether their work is ahead, on track, or behind. They welcome feedback and apply the feedback they received in other contexts.

**Collaboration:** They pair frequently. When starting a new task, they develop a plan for how to accomplish it and validate that plan with a teammate. When stuck for more than 30 minutes on a problem, they get help. They actively participate in code review with the help of a teammate.

## Engineer I (IC 2)

An engineer I is capable of taking on well-defined technical problems and managing their own work each sprint.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have a theoretical understanding of the core concepts and best practices of software engineering and have some practical experience implementing them. They understand the basics of writing performant, well-abstracted code, but need help with complex tasks.

**Productivity:** They are capable of completing small, well-defined tasks on time with minimal help from other engineers. They are mindful of their technical limitations and take them into account when planning their work. They focus on reliably delivering quality work on time. They review their own code first before submitting a PR.

**Impact:** They deliver well-defined tasks that contribute to the team's sprint goals. They actively participate in team norms, processes, and expectations. They deliver the work assigned to them in a sprint often, and demonstrate improved reliability in doing so over time.

**Communication:** They ask questions to understand how their work fits into the larger context. They proactively communicate whether their work is ahead, on track, or behind, and are especially mindful about communicating when work is taking longer than expected. They welcome feedback and apply the feedback they received in other contexts.

**Collaboration:** They pair frequently. They are able to quickly recognize when they are stuck and ask for help. For more complicated tasks, they leverage the knowledge of their peers to plan and execute their work on time. They provide constructive feedback in code review and know when they need help constructing meaningful feedback.

### Responsibilties

* Write and debug code for small features or components.
* Conduct software testing and quality assurance on your own code.
* Create technical documentation for your code, often with guidance.
* Participate in code review and offer constructive feedback.
* Learn the codebase, development processes, and team tools.
* Work on small, self-contained tasks with clear instructions.
* Participate in team meetings and provide progress updates.
* Adhere to team norms, coding standards and best practices.
* Troubleshoot basic software issues and bugs.


## Engineer II (IC 3a)

An engineer II is capable of taking on most technical problems and coordinating work spanning several sprints.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have practical experience implementing the core concepts and best practices of software engineering. They are able to write performant, well-abstracted code with minimal help from other engineers. They are able to solve most problems in their domain, but may need help with complex tasks and tasks outside their domain.

**Productivity:** They reliably deliver the work assigned to them in a sprint. When they encounter a complex problem, they leverage the knowledge of their peers to find a suitable solution, even if it means changing the scope of the work. By the PR stage, their code is well-constructed and largely free of sloppy mistakes.

**Impact:** They routinely take the lead on delivering work critical to meeting the sprint goal and are capable of independently planning work that multiple engineers can complete in several sprints. Instead of just executing on a task as written, they evaluate the proposed solution and suggest changes to ensure that the solution will thoroughly solve the problem.

**Communication:** They effectively review code in their area of expertise and regularly point out opportunities for improvement in the code that they review. They proactively point out concerns with proposed or current sprint work as soon as they see them. They can articulate the tradeoffs of different approaches to solving a problem.

**Collaboration:** They are mindful of the work that others are doing and can critique or suggest improvements to the proposed plans of others. They get help from others when stuck, but are also capable of helping unstick their peers. They are capable of effectively running small to medium-sized projects with regular coaching.

### Responsibilties

* Design and develop software components or features with moderate complexity.
* Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code with less direct supervision.
* Perform more thorough software testing, including unit and integration tests.
* Contribute to technical specifications and requirements.
* Troubleshoot and debug more complex software issues and identify root causes.
* Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback including opportunities to improve code quality.
* Work independently on medium-sized tasks and lead small projects.
* Participate in design discussions and offer technical insights.
* Understand and apply software architecture and design principles.


## Engineer III (IC 4a)

An engineer III is capable of taking on complex technical problems and coordinating work spanning several months.

**Technical Knowledge:** They have a robust understanding of their technical specialty, and a working knowledge of other domains. They can solve most problems in their domain. Their code is well-abstracted and performant and rarely needs a significant refactor at the PR stage. If an unexpected issue/bug does arise, they see developing a solution to that problem as their personal responsibility.

**Productivity:** They are capable of delivering a large volume of work regardless of the complexity/uncertainty of the work. They provide reliable estimates for features that take longer than a single sprint to complete.

**Impact:** An Engineer III takes ownership over the "how" of the feature they implement with a "buck stops here" attitude. They can independently plan work for multiple engineers that will take several sprints to complete. They can identify strategic opportunities and risks with a proposed plan and affect the direction of the team.

**Communication:** They point out novel opportunities for refactoring during code review. They proactively work to minimize or mitigate potential problems before they arise.

**Collaboration:** Others on the team reach out for help in their area of expertise, and they make themselves available. They are capable of effectively running small to medium-sized projects with little to no coaching, but need help to successfully manage large projects.

### Responsibilties

* Lead the design and development of medium to large-scale software features or systems.
* Establish and contribute to team-level software architecture and development standards.
* Mentor and provide technical guidance to junior and mid-level engineers.
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define requirements and contribute to technical roadmaps.
