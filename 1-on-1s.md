# 1:1s at Packback

Packback places a high value on personal growth and professional development. You are encouraged to be proactive about your career growth and development. Your manager is responsible for coaching you and helping facilitate that growth and development.

To that end, every team member has a weekly 1:1 with their manager. The primary purpose of 1:1s is to provide feedback and coaching towards your goals. As such, the onus is on you to proactively set the agenda for your 1:1 with your manager.

## Own your 1:1

You are responsible for coming up with discussion topics for your 1:1 with your manager. This is your opportunity to discuss issues that are on your mind, such as:

- Questions about the business
- Problems that are on your mind
- Blockers to current work
- Career goals and aspirations
- Questions about our product or architecture

While discussion should primarily be driven by you, your manager may also come to a 1:1 with things that they need to discuss, such as:

- Upcoming changes to the team, our process, or the business that might affect you
- Feedback on your performance

## Topics to cover

### In every 1:1

These topics should be addressed in every 1:1.

- **Is there anything on your mind? Are there any specific issues you want to discuss?** - You should spend the majority of the time in your 1:1 here. This is your chance to talk about areas where you want to - grow. This may be in the form of questions about the business, product, or technical architecture, asking for feedback on an area where you are having trouble, or talking about what you want for the future of your career and what needs to happen to get you there. If you have feedback for them, or suggestions of how to improve our process, let them know.
- **How is your relationship with your manager? (Skip-level only)** - 
During skip-level 1:1s (with your manager’s manager), share feedback on how your manager is doing. Do you feel supported by them and satisfied with the coaching you are receiving? What can they do to improve?

### Frequently in 1:1s

These topics don’t need to be covered every week, but you should discuss them frequently (as needed).

- **How are you doing on your OKRs?** - Discuss any changes to your progress towards OKRs, especially changes to the status of your OKRs (completed, on-track, behind, at-risk). This is a great opportunity to discuss risks to hitting OKRs and come up with strategies to get as much value as possible from OKRs if they fall behind.
- **How are you feeling about your work at Packback?** - Share with your manager how you’re feeling. We value developer joy, and want to create a work environment that fosters happiness and satisfaction. For example if there is something you’ve enjoyed working on and want to do more of in the future, let your manager know. On the flip side, if you’re feeling burnt out, frustrated, or bad about something related to your job, talk to your manager about it.
- **Do any items from last week need follow-up conversation?** - Discuss any unresolved items from your last 1:1 that still require additional conversation.

### Question bank

Occasionally, you may not have much to discuss. Use the questions like the ones below to prompt conversation. [This source](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting-questions-great-managers-ask/) has a lot more great examples.

- What do you want to be doing in [6 mo, 1 yr, 2 yrs] that you're not doing now?
- What elements of our process have room for improvement?
- Is there a specific area of our tech stack that you’d like to know more about?
